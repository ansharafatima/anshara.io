                <h2>Behavior</h2>
                <p class="interactive-text">Freddy is known for his stealth and his tendency to become more active as the week progresses. Unlike other animatronics, Freddy tends to remain in the shadows and is difficult to track on the cameras. He is also known for his eerie, slow laugh and his musical jingle that plays when he is close to attacking.</p>
